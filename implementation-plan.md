# MCP Bedrock Knowledge Base Server - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Create an MCP server to interface with AWS Bedrock Knowledge Base for querying AWS Strands Agent documentation. Build as a step-by-step lesson plan.

## Current Status: ✅ READY TO BUILD
- AWS Bedrock KB: ✅ Set up with Strands Agent docs (60+ files)
- AWS Credentials: ✅ Configured 
- Target: Q CLI integration first, then broader MCP compatibility

## Phase 1: Foundation & Setup (✅ COMPLETED)
- ✅ Create lesson plan structure
- ✅ Set up project dependencies  
- ✅ Build minimal MCP server skeleton
- ✅ Initialize git repository with milestones
- ✅ Create virtual environment
- ✅ Test basic MCP protocol communication
- ✅ Create comprehensive educational documentation

**Git Milestones**: 
- `515d096` - Project setup with MCP server skeleton
- `51444e3` - Working MCP server with comprehensive educational content

## Phase 2: AWS Integration (CURRENT)
