# MCP Bedrock Knowledge Base Server - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Create an MCP server to interface with AWS Bedrock Knowledge Base for querying AWS Strands Agent documentation. Build as a step-by-step lesson plan.

## Current Status: ✅ READY TO BUILD
- AWS Bedrock KB: ✅ Set up with Strands Agent docs (60+ files)
- AWS Credentials: ✅ Configured 
- Target: Q CLI integration first, then broader MCP compatibility

## Phase 1: Foundation & Setup (✅ COMPLETED)
- ✅ Create lesson plan structure
- ✅ Set up project dependencies  
- ✅ Build minimal MCP server skeleton
- ✅ Initialize git repository with milestones
- ✅ Create virtual environment
- ✅ Test basic MCP protocol communication
- ✅ Create comprehensive educational documentation

**Git Milestones**: 
- `515d096` - Project setup with MCP server skeleton
- `51444e3` - Working MCP server with comprehensive educational content

## Phase 2: AWS Integration (✅ COMPLETED)
- ✅ Connect to Bedrock Knowledge Base (ID: QVBQZMYI7R)
- ✅ Implement real query functionality
- ✅ Add response formatting with sources
- ✅ Test with sample Strands Agent queries
- ✅ Create lesson 3 with AWS integration details
- ✅ Organize project structure by content type

**Git Milestones**: 
- `515d096` - Project setup with MCP server skeleton
- `51444e3` - Working MCP server with comprehensive educational content
- `531f684` - Hybrid learning structure implementation
- `6e98130` - Organized project structure by content type
- `phase-2-complete` - Full AWS Bedrock Knowledge Base integration

## Phase 5: Knowledge Discovery & Development Planning (✅ COMPLETED)
- ✅ Create systematic knowledge discovery methodology
- ✅ Develop comparative testing framework
- ✅ Document knowledge gap analysis process
- ✅ Create lesson 6 with development planning approach
- ✅ Build comprehensive explanation of discovery process

**Git Milestones**: 
- `515d096` - Project setup with MCP server skeleton
- `51444e3` - Working MCP server with comprehensive educational content
- `531f684` - Hybrid learning structure implementation
- `6e98130` - Organized project structure by content type
- `00825ca` - Phase 2 AWS Bedrock Knowledge Base integration complete
- `1d78a03` - Phase 2 example snapshot created
- `3a1cec6` - MCP protocol test explanation added
- `ca1ee03` - Phase 3 Q CLI integration complete
- `62cb675` - Phase 3 example snapshot and Phase 4 preparation
- `b70e6cc` - Phase 4 Q Developer IDE integration complete
- `phase-5-complete` - Knowledge discovery and development planning methodology

## Phase 6: Comparative Implementation Testing (CURRENT)
- [ ] Implement development task using knowledge base
- [ ] Implement same task without knowledge base access
- [ ] Document differences and value demonstration
- [ ] Create final example snapshot
- [ ] Complete educational resource with all phases
- [ ] Connect to Bedrock Knowledge Base
- [ ] Implement query functionality
- [ ] Add response formatting
- [ ] Test with sample queries

## Phase 3: Q CLI Integration & Testing
- [ ] Configure MCP server for Q CLI
- [ ] Test real queries against Strands docs
- [ ] Refine responses and error handling
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Phase 4: Documentation & Advanced Features
- [ ] Complete lesson plan with examples
- [ ] Add advanced query features
- [ ] Best practices documentation
- [ ] Deployment guide
