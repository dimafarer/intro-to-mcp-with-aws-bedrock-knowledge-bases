# Comparative Testing - Knowledge Base vs General AI

This directory contains a complete comparative testing example demonstrating the value of domain-specific knowledge bases for development tasks.

## Files Overview

### Test Design
- **`development-task-test.md`** - Test specification and methodology
- **`README.md`** - This overview file

### Implementations
- **`implementation_with_kb.py`** - Implementation using knowledge base (accurate Strands APIs)
- **`implementation_without_kb.py`** - Implementation using general AI only (guessed patterns)

### Analysis
- **`comparative-analysis.md`** - Comprehensive comparison of results and ROI analysis

## Test Results Summary

| Metric | With Knowledge Base | Without Knowledge Base |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| API Accuracy | 100% correct | ~30% correct |
| Development Time | 35 minutes | 95 minutes |
| Lines of Code | 156 | 234 |
| Production Ready | ✅ Yes | ❌ Experimental |

## Key Findings

- **63% faster development** with knowledge base
- **100% API accuracy** vs guesswork and fallbacks
- **Production-ready code** vs experimental implementation
- **Framework automation** vs manual session management

## How to Use This Example

1. **Study the Task**: Review `development-task-test.md` for methodology
2. **Compare Implementations**: Examine both Python files side-by-side
3. **Analyze Results**: Read `comparative-analysis.md` for detailed findings
4. **Apply to Your Domain**: Use this framework for your own knowledge base testing

## Educational Value

This example demonstrates:
- How to design fair comparative tests
- The concrete value of domain-specific knowledge bases
- Evidence-based ROI analysis for knowledge base investments
- Strategic justification for MCP server development
