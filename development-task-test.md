# Development Task Test: Knowledge Base vs General AI

## Task Description

**Objective**: Build a Python script that demonstrates persistent conversation handling for a Strands agent that can resume conversations across application restarts.

**Requirements**:
1. Create a Strands agent with session persistence
2. Implement conversation resumption functionality
3. Handle both file-based and cloud-based session storage
4. Include proper error handling for session management
5. Demonstrate the agent maintaining context across restarts

**Specific Technical Challenges**:
- Configure session managers properly
- Handle session persistence triggers
- Implement conversation continuity
- Manage agent state across sessions
- Choose appropriate session storage backend

## Test Methodology

I will attempt this task twice:

### Test 1: Using Knowledge Base Enhanced AI
- Use our MCP server with Strands documentation
- Leverage specific technical details from knowledge base
- Access detailed API documentation and examples

### Test 2: Using General AI Knowledge Only
- No access to Strands-specific documentation
- Rely only on general Python and AI agent patterns
- Make educated guesses about API structure

## Success Criteria

**Functional Requirements**:
- [ ] Agent can persist conversations
- [ ] Sessions resume correctly after restart
- [ ] Proper error handling implemented
- [ ] Code follows best practices

**Technical Accuracy**:
- [ ] Correct Strands API usage
- [ ] Proper session manager configuration
- [ ] Appropriate persistence triggers
- [ ] Accurate import statements and class names

**Code Quality**:
- [ ] Clear documentation
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Maintainable structure
- [ ] Production-ready patterns

## Expected Differences

**With Knowledge Base**:
- Accurate API usage and class names
- Specific configuration options
- Proper session management patterns
- Detailed error handling scenarios

**Without Knowledge Base**:
- Generic patterns that may not match Strands API
- Guessed class names and methods
- Basic error handling
- May miss Strands-specific features

*This test will demonstrate the value of domain-specific knowledge bases for development tasks.*
