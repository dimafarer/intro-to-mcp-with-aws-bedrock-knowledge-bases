# Lesson 6: Development Planning with Your Knowledge Base

## Learning Objectives
- Use your MCP server to discover new technical information
- Transform knowledge base insights into development tasks
- Compare knowledge-enhanced vs general AI development
- Understand the value proposition of custom knowledge bases

## What We're Building
A systematic approach to using your custom knowledge base for development planning, task creation, and technical decision-making.

## Prerequisites
- Completed Phase 4 (Q Developer integration working)
- Understanding of your domain knowledge base content
- Familiarity with development task planning

## Key Concepts

### Knowledge Discovery Process
1. **Exploratory Queries**: Ask broad questions to discover capabilities
2. **Deep Dive Queries**: Focus on specific technical areas
3. **Gap Analysis**: Identify what's new or different from general knowledge
4. **Task Synthesis**: Transform discoveries into actionable development tasks

### Why This Matters for Development
- **Domain Expertise**: Access specialized knowledge not in general AI training
- **Current Information**: Get up-to-date documentation and patterns
- **Specific APIs**: Learn exact class names, methods, and configurations
- **Best Practices**: Discover domain-specific patterns and conventions

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Knowledge Discovery Through Systematic Querying

**Broad Exploration**:
```
Query: "What are the main components of AWS Strands Agent framework?"
Purpose: Understand overall architecture and capabilities
```

**Technical Deep Dive**:
```
Query: "How does Strands agent session management work? What are the specific methods and configuration options?"
Purpose: Discover detailed technical implementation patterns
```

**API Specifics**:
```
Query: "What are the exact class names and import statements for Strands session managers?"
Purpose: Get precise technical details for implementation
```

### Step 2: Gap Analysis - What's New to You?

**Compare Against General Knowledge**:
- What specific APIs or patterns are mentioned?
- Are there unique configuration options?
- What domain-specific concepts are explained?
- Which implementation details are framework-specific?

**Example Discovery**:
From our query, we learned about:
- `FileSessionManager` and `S3SessionManager` classes
- Automatic persistence triggers (agent initialization, message addition, etc.)
- Specific import patterns: `from strands.session.file_session_manager import FileSessionManager`
- Session lifecycle management concepts

### Step 3: Task Creation Based on Discoveries

**Transform Knowledge into Development Challenge**:
```
Discovery: Strands has specific session management with FileSessionManager and S3SessionManager
â†“
Task: Build a persistent conversation system that can resume across restarts
â†“
Challenge: Implement both local and cloud session storage options
```

### Step 4: Comparative Development Testing

**Test Your Knowledge Base Value**:
1. Attempt task using your MCP server
2. Attempt same task without knowledge base access
3. Compare accuracy, completeness, and implementation quality
4. Document the differences and value gained

## Understanding the Discovery Process

### Key Concepts
- **Knowledge Gap Analysis**: Identifying what's new vs general AI knowledge
- **Systematic Querying**: From broad exploration to specific technical details
- **Task Synthesis**: Transforming discoveries into development challenges
- **Comparative Testing**: Measuring knowledge base value through implementation

### The Discovery Process

**Initial Query**: "How does Strands agent session management work?"

**Key Discoveries**:
- Session persistence is automatic, triggered by specific events
- Two built-in session managers: `FileSessionManager` and `S3SessionManager`
- Sessions include conversation history, agent state, and other stateful information
- Specific API pattern: `Agent(session_manager=session_manager)`

**Why This is Valuable**:
- These specific class names wouldn't be in general AI training
- The automatic persistence concept is framework-specific
- The exact import statements and usage patterns are documented
- Error handling and best practices are included

### Task Creation

**Development Challenge Created**:
Build a Python script demonstrating persistent conversation handling for Strands agents that can resume conversations across application restarts.

**Why This Tests Knowledge Base Value**:
- Requires specific Strands API knowledge
- Tests understanding of session management concepts
- Validates correct usage of framework-specific patterns
- Demonstrates practical application of discovered knowledge

## Expected Learning Outcomes

### Understanding Knowledge Base ROI
Students learn to:
- Quantify the value of domain-specific knowledge
- Identify gaps in general AI knowledge
- Use custom knowledge bases strategically
- Plan development tasks based on available expertise

### Development Planning Skills
- Systematic knowledge discovery
- Technical requirement analysis
- Comparative evaluation methods
- Evidence-based decision making

## Best Practices for Knowledge Discovery

### 1. Start Broad, Then Narrow
```
Broad: "What is AWS Strands?"
Specific: "How do I configure Strands session persistence?"
Detailed: "What are the exact parameters for S3SessionManager?"
```

### 2. Focus on Implementation Details
- Ask for specific class names and methods
- Request configuration examples
- Inquire about error handling patterns
- Seek best practice recommendations

### 3. Validate Through Task Creation
- Transform discoveries into practical challenges
- Test knowledge through implementation
- Compare results with and without knowledge base
- Document value gained

### 4. Iterate and Refine
- Use initial discoveries to ask better questions
- Build on previous responses for deeper understanding
- Refine tasks based on knowledge depth
- Continuously improve your knowledge base queries

## Next Steps
After mastering knowledge discovery and task creation, you'll be ready to:
- Use your MCP server for real development projects
- Make informed technical decisions based on domain expertise
- Continuously expand your knowledge base with new discoveries
- Train others on domain-specific development patterns
